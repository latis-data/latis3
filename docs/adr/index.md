# Architectural Decision Log

Important decisions are made throughout the evolution of a project that sometimes seem arbitrary or simply wrong to new members to the team. By documenting why decisions were made, a deeper understanding of tradeoffs can give team members an appreciation for why decisions were made. More importantly, as requirements and circumstances change, previous design decisions may need to be re-visited and modified to meet the needs of a project. Understanding the full pros and cons of design decisions will enhance the confidence to reverse previous decisions when it becomes necessary to do so.

This log lists the architectural decisions for the LaTiS 3 project.
