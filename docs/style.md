#LaTiS Style Guidelines

##Scala

Our baseline for scala code style is https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/
with scalafmt (https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) defaults trumping those.
Exceptional cases will be described here and captured in our scalafmt
configuration as appropriate.

##Scaladoc

We use the Javadoc comment style:

```
  /**
   * First line.
   */
```

##FDML

FDML should use XML style guidelines. We use 2 space indents with attributes 
aligned when they are too long for a single line.
