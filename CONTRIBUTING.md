# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LaTiS.

## Process

If there is something you would like to see in LaTiS, regardless of whether you would like to help add it, we encourage you to [create an issue](https://github.com/latis-data/latis3/issues) to discuss.

We use the [fork and pull model][fork]. You will need to fork this repository, create a branch in your fork, and make a pull request when you are done.

## Development Environment

You will need [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to work on LaTiS.

If you use Nix, you can run `nix develop` to enter a development environment.

## Style Guidelines

We do not yet have automatic formatting configured. In the mean time, try to match the surrounding style.

If you're writing entirely new code, keep in mind that we are using Scala 3 with braces.
